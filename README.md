# My Curriculum Vitae

### Description
 This is a simple static webpage I've designed to use as my curriculum vitae. It was made with NextJS.

 The majority of the website uses Server Side Rendering to make it easier for web-crawlers to read the information.

 Certificates can also be clicked on to display the according image.

 Currently deployed using GitHub Pages.
